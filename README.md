# üìä E-Commerce Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **E-commerce sales data** using **SQL** for querying and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The goal is to identify key sales trends, customer insights, and profitability metrics that can help improve decision-making.

## üóÑ Database Details
The project uses two main tables:  

- **`details`** ‚Üí Transaction details  
  - Columns: Order ID, Category, Sub-Category, Amount, Quantity, Profit, Payment Mode  
- **`orders`** ‚Üí Customer orders  
  - Columns: Order ID, CustomerName, State, City

-- Window Function: Top 2 Sub-Categories by Amount in each Category
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Category,
        `Sub-Category`,
